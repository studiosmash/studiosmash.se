                <h1>QATAR DEVELOPMENT BANK</h1>
                <p>STUDIO SMASH was tasked with creating the branding and content for QDB's most recent tent at Darb Al Saai.</p>
                <p>Over 5000 children visited the tent, experiencing what it means to start a company and the important decisions they must make in order for it to be successful. For the experience we created all content for the event, including 3D films, conductive ink walls, touchscreen applications and a state of the art augmented reality game. The positive response was overwhelming and it will now be implemented as a permanent installation in Qatar next year.</p>
