            <p>SMASH was tasked with creating the branding and content for Qatar Development Banks’s most recent tent at Darb Al Saai, during Qatar’s national day celebration.</p>
            <p>Over 6000 children visited the tent, experiencing what it means to start a company and the important decisions they must make in order for it to be successful. For the experience SMASH created all content for the event, including 3D films, conductive ink interactive walls, touchscreen applications and a state of the art augmented reality game. The positive response was overwhelming and it will now be implemented as a permanent installation in Qatar later this year.</p>

            <p>The experience was designed to take the children on a journey. This journey took the children from registration, to deciding which business area they would like to focus on, all the way to designing a poster for their company.</p>
            <p>In order to do this we created a custom app that allowed the information to flow between each stage of the experience.</p>

            <p>The AR game SMASH created was centred around the practical decisions that must be taken when starting a business. The size and type of premises that might suit the chosen business, the area of Doha in which to open this business and how many staff to hire were all covered in the game. Feedback on these decisions was also presented to the player at the end, providing information on what was right and what maybe to think about next time.</p>

            <p>The journey began with a 2 minute inspirational 3D video about what it means to be an entrepreneur and why it can important in this day and age.</p>
            <p>The video centred around the main character we created for the whole event, Hamad. This character, animations and all the assets featured were created by our 3D team from scratch for the project.</p>
